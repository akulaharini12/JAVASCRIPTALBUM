  JAVA :JAVA is a programming language,it is a high-level language,  
        object-oriented programming language.

    ==>    JAVA -programming language is developed by "sun microsystens" in "1995"
           (now owned by oracle corpration).

    ==>    Java is secure.

    ==>    It Built-in security features for safe execution, especially in networked environment.

    ==>    Java it is multithread for buildingresponsive and high-performance apps.

    ==>    It is known for its "platform independence" robustness and scalability.

    ==>    Most popular for building applications.

    ==>    Java is a platform because it can run on any device with a " JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE ".

    ==>    Java is a compiled & interpreted code is compiled into bytecode which is executed by the " JVM ".

    ==>    In java data types must be declared, catching many errors at compile time.

    ==>    Java has Garbage collection that handles memorey allocation and cleanup.

SYNTAX :

         System.out.println(" ");

       Eg : System.out.println("Hello World");

        # int number=10;
        
        # string name="Harini";

    Why Java is platform independence?

    ==> The program can run in any operating system like 
        [Windows, Mac, Linux,etc]

    # Java is a backend programming language.

    # In springboot,web applications it performs as a frontend.

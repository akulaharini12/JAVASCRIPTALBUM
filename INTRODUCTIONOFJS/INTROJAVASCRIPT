JAVA SCRIPT : It is a programming language.

            ==>  It is a scripting language because it designed for small script that control the 
                 behaviour of web pages within the browser.

            ==>  It is a lightweight cross platform and single threaded programming language.

            ==>  JAVA SCRIPT is created by "BRENDAN EICH " in the year 1995.
                 At netscape in just 10 days.

            ==>  JAVA SCRIPT - LIVE SCRIPT - ECMA SCRIPT
                                               |
                                              1997

            ==>  Node.js released in the year 2009.

            ==>  In 2015 Es6 (ECMA Script 2015) introduce morden features 
                  (classes,arrow functions,etc).

            ==>  JAVA SCRIPT is interpreted because it runs in real-time inside the browser, no need for compilation.

            ==>  It is a interpreted language it executes code line by line providing more flexibility.

        Why JAVA SCRIPT is an Interpreted language ?

          ==> JAVA SCRIPT is an Interpreted language because its code is typically executed directly by the browser
              without a seprate compilation step.
          
          ==> Here instead of compiling the total program it runs the code line by line.

        Why JAVA SCRIPT is an Dynamically Typed ?

          ==> In JAVA SCRIPT we dont need to declare the type of a varibale and also type of variables can change at runtime.

          EXAMPLE : 
          
                let x=10;----------> x is a number.

                x="hello";---------> x is a string.

                x = true;----------> x is a Boolean.

        Is JAVA SCRIPT is front end or back end ?

          ==> JAVA SCRIPT is both front end and back end because front end in web application / browsers --> (client side)  

          ==> Back end in full stack program with tools like 
                      Node.js --> (server side)  development.

    SYNTAX OF JAVA SCRIPT :

              Console.log(" ");
